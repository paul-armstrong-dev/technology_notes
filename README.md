# Technology Notes
Just a personal repo containing all notes I have after working with 
and becoming fluent in a technology, so far have only added: 

##### 1. Python 
- **Style Guide**:
    - These are some more general notes in python
  -   Written for and while working at RTL, but tried to keep it as
      generic as possible and more around best practises and useful
      packages
##### 2. Docker     
- **Networking guide**:
    - Notes on and a bit of an easier how - to for implementing container
    communication in docker networks. 
    - Had a bit of a night mare getting this setup and understood 
    so thought I had to document it
